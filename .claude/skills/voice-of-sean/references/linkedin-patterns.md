# LinkedIn Post Patterns

Reference patterns based on Sean's actual LinkedIn posts.

## Post Types

### Announcement Post

**Use for**: Company news, launches, funding, rebrands

**Structure**:

1. Big news hook: "I'm excited to announce..." or "[Old] is now [New]!"
2. The why: What insight led to this
3. What it means: 2-4 bullet points of capabilities or outcomes
4. Gratitude + forward look

**Example opener**:

```text
9root is now Isomer!

After working closely with our design partners, we've learned the systems that truly scale don't just replace what exists. They take the essential elements and restructure them with AI to perform dramatically better.
```

**Example closer**:

```text
Grateful for everyone who's been part of the journey and excited for what's ahead!
```

### Thinking Out Loud Post

**Use for**: Industry observations, technical insights, emerging patterns

**Structure**:

1. Frame it as ongoing thinking: "Continuing my out-loud thinking on..."
2. Define without over-defining: "I don't want to give yet another definition..."
3. List key attributes or observations
4. Balanced take: what's compelling AND what's broken
5. Invitation to discuss

**Example opener**:

```text
Continuing my out-loud thinking on vertically-focused, agentically-powered service as software startups (VASaS? lol), I'd like to talk about AI agents.

I don't want to give yet another definition. There are plenty of those and I don't have any special qualifications that would make mine any better. I will however list some key attributes...
```

**Example closer**:

```text
I'm fascinated by agents and I'm interested in talking to other developers who are also working with agentic frameworks. I think the only way to really be an expert is to be actively building agents that solve hard problems.
```

### Technical Insight Post

**Use for**: Lessons learned, architectural patterns, industry analysis

**Structure**:

1. Hook with pattern or question: "Here's one pattern I keep seeing:" or "After [time] building [X], I've come to think..."
2. Concrete example or story
3. The shift/insight: "The shift for us came when..."
4. Why this works (brief)
5. Lessons or patterns that emerged
6. Closing question to reader

**Example opener**:

```text
At Isomer, we've been focused on a specific question. Why isn't AI implemented at scale in insurance yet?

Here's one pattern I keep seeing:
```

**Example closer**:

```text
If you are building enterprise AI that has to survive real-world chaos, ask yourself: where does your context live, and what happens when things go wrong?
```

## Style Notes

**ALL CAPS for section headers** in longer posts (THE SHIFT, WHY THIS WORKS, THE LESSON)

**Short paragraphs**: 1-3 sentences max in LinkedIn format

**Balanced takes**: Always acknowledge both upside and problems

- "Copilots are awesome productivity boosts, but agents are a giant step forward..."
- "That said, agents are not a panacea. Agents can be unpredictable..."

**Specific over vague**: Use real examples, timeframes, numbers when you have them

- "in 12-24 months" not "soon"
- "We've been doing X for a year" not "We've been doing X for a while"

**Self-aware humor**: Light, usually parenthetical

- "(VASaS? lol)"
- "There's probably some formula somewhere that describes..."

## What NOT to Do

- Don't start with "🚀 Exciting news!" or similar
- Don't use hashtags mid-sentence
- Don't make unsubstantiated claims
- Don't be vague about tradeoffs
- Don't end every post with a call-to-action (sometimes just end)
- Don't use emdashes (use commas, periods, or "and")
