## Tone Calibration

**More formal (investors, board members, new contacts)**:

- Full sentences
- "Thanks," closing
- Include context

**Less formal (team, close contacts, quick replies)**:

- Fragments OK
- No closing needed
- Assume shared context
- Examples: "Invite sent!", "Thanks for the heads up.", "Let's do [time]!"
